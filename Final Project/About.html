          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Welcome to my personal website! I am an undergraduate Computer Science student from Harare, Zimbabwe, currently residing in Rzeszow, Poland. I enjoy watching football, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new tools to enhance my skills.</p>
          <p>On this website, you'll find a glimpse into my world of interests. I have a passion for books, games, and series, and I'd love to share my favorites with you.</p>
          <p>When it comes to books, I highly recommend "The Pelican Brief" by John Grisham, "Seven Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen R. Covey, and "Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki. Each of these books offers valuable insights and perspectives.</p>
          <p>If you're a gaming enthusiast, you should definitely check out "FIFA 23," "The Last of Us Part II," and "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2." These games provide thrilling experiences and captivating gameplay.</p>
          <p>For series lovers, I suggest diving into "The Walking Dead," "Breaking Bad," and "The Office." These shows offer gripping storylines and memorable characters.</p>
          <p>Feel free to explore the rest of my website and get in touch if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.</p>
